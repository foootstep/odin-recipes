# odin-recipes

My first project in HTML. A simple cooking recipe list with ingredients and procedures. 

Using my basic knowledge in html that I've learned from TheOdinProject, I've utilized the list, images, and link tags.

I might add more recipes and make the page aesthetically and functionally better when I have learned more about coding.
