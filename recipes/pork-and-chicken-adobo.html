    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1¼ pounds boneless pork loin roast, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1¼ pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt, or amount to taste</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon black peppercorns, coarsely ground</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons crushed garlic</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, torn</li>
        <li>1 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Procedures:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season pork and chicken with salt and pepper and place in a stock pot. Rub with crushed garlic and torn bay leaf, and coat with vinegar and soy sauce. Cover, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Bring meat and marinating liquid to a boil in a cast iron casserole or Dutch oven. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook until meat is tender, about 30 minutes. If necessary, add water to prevent sauce from drying out.</li>
        <li>Strain liquid from meat and set aside; discard bay leaves. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the pork and chicken on all sides; reduce heat and stir in remaining 2 cloves of smashed garlic. Cook and stir for 2 minutes more. Pour in reserved cooking liquid, and continue simmering until sauce is slightly thickened. Serve hot.</li>
